If you dont understand the definitions in the start , then check the structure of the code  , that might help you 
Watch the video first(not all of it at once) , then look at my code and notes.

I used chatgpt heavily to understand this but Most of the concepts were taken from the video.
If you dont understand the definitions in the start , then maybe executing (writing the code from the video ) might work.
Remember , writing code helps alot , even sometimes if you dont understand it , but be consistent.
The main challenge is to find errors/bugs or why your code doesnt work .
Ask chatgpt question like your a laymen , example ask chatgpt to  "explain this to me(code) like im a layman"
